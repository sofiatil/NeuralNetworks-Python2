# NeuralNetworks-Python2
 This repository implements the second lab exercise for the "Neural Networks" course. It focuses on using recurrent neural networks to solve sequence-to-sequence problems, specifically comparing RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures for estimating the power consumption of a specific appliance based on total household consumption.
